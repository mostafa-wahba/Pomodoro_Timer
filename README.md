# Pomodoro_Timer
This Pomodoro Timer project is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to set a timer for focused work sessions and breaks, following the Pomodoro Technique. The timer visually represents the remaining time with a progress circle. Users can start, pause, and reset the timer as needed.
